## About the POSTCSS

PostCSS is a tool to transform css plugin into javascript. Plugin ecosystem, Helps improve the performance, support upcoming css features. Let's consider a common scenario where we want to add vendor prefixes to CSS properties for cross-browser compatibility. In normal CSS, we need to manually add these prefixes, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. In Sass, we can use mixins or libraries like Compass to handle prefixes, but it still involves additional setup and may require updates. With PostCSS, we can use a plugin like Autoprefixer, which automatically adds the necessary vendor prefixes based on the specified browser support. PostCSS has plugin based modular architecture.
