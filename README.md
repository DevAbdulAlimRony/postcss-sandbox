## About the POSTCSS

<ul align="justify">
<li>PostCSS is a tool to transform css plugin into javascript. Plugin ecosystem, Helps improve the performance, support upcoming css features.</li>
<li>Cutting Edge Feature- Future CSS use in Present. Processing Speed is best</li>
<li>Let's consider a common scenario where we want to add vendor prefixes to CSS properties for cross-browser compatibility. In normal CSS, we need to manually add these prefixes, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. In Sass, we can use mixins or libraries like Compass to handle prefixes, but it still involves additional setup and may require updates. With PostCSS, we can use a plugin like Autoprefixer, which automatically adds the necessary vendor prefixes based on the specified browser support. PostCSS has plugin based modular architecture.</li>
<li>When you install Sass, you get all the built-in functionalities, including features like @import, mixins, variables, and more, without needing any additional plugins. Sass is a fully-featured CSS preprocessor that includes these functionalities out of the box. On the other hand, when you use PostCSS, it is more of a modular system, and you need to install specific plugins to add various functionalities to your CSS processing pipeline. By default, PostCSS does not include the @import functionality. Instead, you can use the postcss-import plugin to enable the @import functionality in your PostCSS workflow.</li>
<li>SAAS has built in package manager CLI, POSTCSS has to install CLI</li>
